        <p class="para_into">JavaScript is a cross-platform, 
            object-oriented scripting language.
             It is a small and lightweight language. 
             Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
             environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
