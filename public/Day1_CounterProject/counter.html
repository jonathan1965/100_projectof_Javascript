              growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to
              express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity
              to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of
              people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed.

              It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
              is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
              offended by it, it doesn't matter. Because it's about motivating the
              doers. Because I'm here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to
              follow their dreams, too.

              The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun
              people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out. But
              the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in
              what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed it? If
              everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just
              the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so
              scared to lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing people can't
              say is that I'm not trying, and I'm not trying my hardest, and I'm not
              trying to do the best way I know how.

                  Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
                  Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
                  live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
                  language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
                  supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic
                  country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
